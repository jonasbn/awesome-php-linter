# Awesome PHP Linter

> A nice list of linting utility for PHP on the GitHub.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.

- [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) - Analyzes some PHP source code and tries to fix coding standards issues ([PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) compatible).
- [PHP Mess Detector](https://github.com/phpmd/phpmd) - PHPMD is a spin-off project of [PHP Depend](https://pdepend.org/) and aims to be a PHP equivalent of the well known Java tool PMD. PHPMD can be seen as an user friendly frontend application for the raw metrics stream measured by PHP Depend.
- [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) - PHP_CodeSniffer tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.
- [PHP Parallel Lint](https://github.com/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Parallel-Lint) - This tool check syntax of PHP files faster than serial check with fancier output.
